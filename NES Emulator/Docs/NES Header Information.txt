iNES header information.

Starting Byte 	Length (Bytes) Contents
	0 		3 	Should contain the string ‘NES’ to identify the file as an iNES file.
	3 		1 	Should contain the value $1A, also used to identify file format.
	4 		1 	Number of 16 KB PRG-ROM banks. The PRG-ROM (Program ROM) is the area of ROM used to store the program code.
	5 		1 	Number of 8 KB CHR-ROM / VROM banks. The names CHR-ROM (Character ROM) and VROM are used synonymously to refer 						to the area of ROM used to store graphics information, the pattern tables.
	6 		1 	ROM Control Byte 1:
				• Bit 0 - Indicates the type of mirroring used by the game where 0 indicates horizontal mirroring, 
				          1 indicates vertical mirroring.
				• Bit 1 - Indicates the presence of battery-backed RAM at memory locations $6000-$7FFF.
				• Bit 2 - Indicates the presence of a 512-byte trainer at memory locations $7000-$71FF.
				• Bit 3 - If this bit is set it overrides bit 0 to indicate fourscreen mirroring should be used.
				• Bits 4-7 - Four lower bits of the mapper number.
	7 		1 	ROM Control Byte 2:
				• Bits 0-3 - Reserved for future usage and should all be 0.
				• Bits 4-7 - Four upper bits of the mapper number.
	8 		1	Number of 8 KB RAM banks. For compatibility with previous versions of the iNES format, assume 1 page of RAM when
				this is 0.
	9 		7 	Reserved for future usage and should all be 0

Following the header is the 512-byte trainer, if one is present, otherwise the ROM banks
begin here, starting with PRG-ROM then CHR-ROM. The format allows for up to 256
different memory mappers. Each mapper is assigned a specific number and the mapper
number can be obtained by shifting bits 4-7 of control byte 2 to the left by 4 bits and then
adding the bits 4-7 of control byte 1.
