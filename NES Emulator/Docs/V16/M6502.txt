Prefix Software Team Info

Name: M6502
Version: V.15f
Author: Donald Jarrett
Info: Ported from a C source Neil Bradley gave to the 
Emulation Repository. This version has many bugs which
will be fixed by the next version. Give credit to me
and Neil Bradley and send email to me before using this.

ToDo: Correctly emulate brk6502(). Speed up. 

A note to whoever else ports the C code: You cannot do
certain things in VB5. You cannot encounter a bad opcode
in this 6502 emulator. Reasons: All invalid opcodes are
set to NOP. I have had 260 downloads in the last two weeks,
which means this is midly popular. This one has been worked on frantically and has been improved
a lot since release .1. There's not much point to a new
6502 emulator in VB5 since there are already 2 of them
and the other one also works pretty good. mNES *HAS* been cancelled, and
basicNES(a long lost NES emulator from *1996*) has been restarted. Any
help decoding NES chars would be great.
 
V.16(2/ /98):
- Yaya... brk6502 finally working.
- irq6502 also fixed...
- A few speed ups, nothing noticeable.

V.15e(2/2/98):
- Fixed a bug in the sed6502 instruction(I think!)
where instead of P = P or &H1, it said P=P or &O1.
- Fixed instructions like this:
       value=gameimage(pc+1)
I now have:
       value=gameimage(pc)
       pc=pc+1
Most of the instructions like this are fixed.
- Watch for mNES V.10 soon!

V.15d(2/1/98):
- Some addressing modes were not working right. This is
fixed in this version. 
- What do you think of these updates? Good, bad, or 
ugly? Send your comments to r.jarrett@worldnet.att.net.

V.15c(1/31/98):
- Some OpCodes did not have the addressing mode stuff. This
is now fixed.
- Help me with brk6502!!!!!!!

V.15b(1/31/98):
- Rewrote the Select Case statement in exec6502 like this:
Select case instruction(opcode)
case "lda6502": lda6502
end select
kinda like that. Makes it work better I think. 
- Tested Super Mario Bros. on it: It looped because it's
waiting for input from the user. 
- mNES now has a simple tile viewer.

V.15(11/16/97):
Apparently, V.14b and down weren't doing addressing modes
right. Me and Akilla^ have fixed it in this version. This
is a latest update. I'm going to try to re-write the code
for a total speed increase. This one is not based on anything,
just me writing. =). However, I will still continue to
update this older M6502.

V.14b(11/7/97):
Wow, up to 700 downloads, or maybe 800 now. Thanks to 
everyone who has downloaded it. This is a minor update.
Source:
- Keep trying to get brk6502() working but it just won't.
Someone email me if they can get it working...
- Added OpCode &H80 to &H8F because they were missing.
- Added more to CPU1 Type. I deleted this section of the
source because it's not working yet.
- Debugging Version. Set TrapBadOps to 1 so the emulation
will quit when a bad opcode(case else in exec6502) is
encountered.

V.14a(11/6/97):
Wow, 300 downloads in the last two days. Thanx to everyone
who has supported it. As you can see, I skipped V.13 because
I don't like that number. Source Updates:
- Added CPU(0 to 4) for multiple CPUs(You arcade emu authors).
It's commented out in this version, very preliminary.
- Jurassic Park for NES runs for 8000 instructions!!!
This is the first game i've gotten to run it.

V.12(11/4/97):
Added some new stuff and Addressing Modes for every instruction.
Made it more like the C code. 
Added homepage(unimportant)!

V.11(11/3/97): 
Sui` finished the Select Case statements for me...

V.1(11/2/97):
Initial Release

This emulator can be used in Atari 800 stuff, Atari 2600, NES, 
Atari Arcades(Vector games =)) emulators and others.
